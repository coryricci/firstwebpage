	<h1>
	First things First: 
	</h1>
	<p class=fancy>This is not only my first webpage, but its a look into my past and how I begin to pave the raod to my future!</p>
	 <h2>Second: who am I?</h2>
<p>I'll start this out by telling you that I dont have a degree in computer science - or in anything for that matter! In fact,<br> at the moment i'm a metal fabricator! Not excatly what you were expecting, right? Good!</p>
	<h2>Third: What this means!</h2>
<p>This means that I need to try harder than someone who had gone to school for programming and coding. That doesnt scare me,<br> if I had gone to school for this I probably wouldnt be much good at it. Thats not to say that the teachers arent good at what they do, <br>rather i'm much better at small group lessons and just getting at it and practicing first hand!Ill let my passion and persiverence <br>get me to where I need to be. Ofcoarse I do have a few key skills that are hard to teach which might help to push me ahead,<br> Ill describe these skills in just a second!</p>	
		<h2>Fourth:Skills i've learned along the way</h2>
<p>Its clear at this point that I dont posses the highest coding skill set out there, but thats ok. What I do have is strong leadership skills which means that I also have strong team skills. A major part of this was learning how the two roles go hand in hand to creat a symetry amoung co-workers. Its not just demanding everyone doing what you say or just doing what someone else says- no,its more of finding that middle ground, when to lead and take control when youre sure of the task at hand and when to fall back and learn when you dont! Also this industry is constantly changing and growing which means that cognitive ability is a must!Learning on the fly is a huge part of the trade I am in now and I find myself to be very good at it! So much so, that I for the most part enjoy pressured situations because they are the tests that show me how far I've progressed. These skills ultimately help me to become good at more than asects of the what ever project I'm a part of!  </p>
